        <h1>Wyatt Dennis Project Idea</h1>
        <h3>A brief description of my project idea for <abbr title="World Health Organization">IST263</abbr></h3>
    </header>
    <p>My idea for the project is a website that details my favorite music of the last few years. I want to share my thoughts and opinions on recent music releases, and rank my favorite albums and singles of 2019 so far. I would also like to dedicate part of the website to my favorite production as well. All of my content will come from using images of album covers, which is covered under fair use.</p>
