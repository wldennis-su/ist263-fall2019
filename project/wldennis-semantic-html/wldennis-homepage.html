    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Wyatt Dennis and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University in New York. I am studying television/radio/film at the Newhouse School of Public Communications and information management and technology at the iSchool. I am from Danville, California, which is about a 40 minute drive from San Francisco. My interests include music, film, videogames, and having a good time with friends. In the future I would like to work in the film industry, the music industry, or in the IT business. I have a huge passion in hip-hop music, and I even produce my own beats.</p>
